# A simple map-building to work with the PacMan AI projects from:
#
# http://ai.berkeley.edu/
#
# These use a simple API that allow us to control Pacman's interaction with
# the environment adding a layer on top of the AI Berkeley code.
#
# As required by the licensing agreement for the PacMan AI we have:

# Licensing Information:  You are free to use or extend these projects for
# educational purposes provided that (1) you do not distribute or publish
# solutions, (2) you retain this notice, and (3) you provide clear

# Attribution Information: The Pacman AI projects were developed at UC Berkeley.
# The core projects and autograders were primarily created by John DeNero

# The map itself is implemented as a nested list, and the interface
# allows it to be accessed by specifying x, y locations.

class Grid:

    # Constructor
    #
    # Note that it creates variables:
    #
    # grid:   an array that has one position for each element in the grid.
    # width:  the width of the grid
    # height: the height of the grid
    #
    # Grid elements are not restricted, so you can place whatever you
    # like at each location. You just have to be careful how you
    # handle the elements when you use them.
